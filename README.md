# ebpfpub

ebpfpub is a Linux library that can be used to record system call activity. It works by generating eBPF programs that are then attached to the system tracepoints.

## How it works

### Tracepoint events
Tracing is performed by attaching eBPF programs to the system tracepoints. For each syscall defined on the system, two distinct events are emitted: **enter** and **event**.

The **enter** event happens as soon as the syscall is called, and carries all the parameters that have been passed from user mode. It does not contain the exit code, and all the **out** buffers are yet to be filled.

The **exit** event in constrast does not contain any of the **enter** parameters. It does provide the exit code however, and by this event is emitted all the **out** parameters have been filled.

### Handling events
ebfpub generates two different programs in order to handle both events; the **enter** program is responsible for taking a snapshot of all the parameters and is automatically generated by the library. This is enough to capture all parameters by value, but will not dereference pointers.

The **exit** program is special, because each system call behaves differently, so the library can only initialize the code and then defer the rest of the code generation step to a serializer that knows how each specific system call works. Since all the parameters have already been copied automatically by the library, the serializer's job is to dereference pointers (example: the sockaddr_in structure of the connect() system call) and make sure they are returned back to the library.

Provided with the library, a **generic** system call serializer is used as a fallback whenever a more specialized implementation is not available. This generator is capable of serializing null-terminated `char *` strings, making it suitable for handling more than half the system calls offered by the Linux kernel.

### Program generation
Programs are generated by parsing the tracepoint event format file found in the [ftrace](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/trace/ftrace.txt) directory. The **enter** program is responsible for generating the event entry, containing the event header (process id, thread id, timestamp, etc...) and the system call parameters. The **exit** program will then locate the generated event entry and, if necessary, perform additional tasks such as capturing strings and buffers. Once event entry is ready, it is sent back to user mode using the perf_events output.

### Program resources
Whenever a pair of eBPF programs is allocated to trace a system call, certain resources are required:

* **Event map**: A per-syscall map, used to store event entries. These entries are generated by the **enter** program, passed to the **exit** program, and then sent to user mode.
* **Event stack map**: A per-syscall map, used as stack space to work around the program stack limitations provided by the eBPF architecture. This is automatically allocated by the library.
* **Buffer storage**: This object is a combination of a set of indices and a map containing arrays. It is used to capture strings and buffers, and can be shared across multiple system call tracepoints. It is also possible to allocate private buffer storages for system calls that are more memory hungry than others.
* **Buffer storage stack**: A per-syscall map, not unlike the **Event stack map**, that is used to work around the eBPF stack limitations. It is automatically allocated by the library.
* **Perf output**: This object is the communication channel between the probe and user mode. It can be shared across multiple tracepoints, but it is also possible to create 

Some of the above resources require the use of per-CPU maps, which perform the same allocation once per CPU core. The Buffer Storage and Perf Output objects tend to consume quite a bit of memory, depending on how they are allocated. Both classes have methods to retrieve the exact amount of bytes allocated.

## Building

### Prerequisites
* A recent Clang/LLVM installation (8.0 or better), compiled with BPF support
* A recent libc++ or stdc++ library, supporting C++17
* CMake
* Linux kernel >= 4.18 (Ubuntu 18.10)

Please note that LLVM itself must be compiled with libc++ when enabling the `EBPFPUB_ENABLE_LIBC++` option, since ebfpub will directly link against the LLVM libraries.

### Steps

1. Obtain the source code: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/trailofbits/ebpfpub`
2. In case the `--recursive` flag was not provided, run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
3. Enter the source folder: `cd ebpfpub`
4. Create the build folder: `mkdir build && cd build`
5. Configure the project: `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=RelWithDebInfo -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER:STRING=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:STRING=clang++ -DEBPFPUB_ENABLE_TESTS:BOOLEAN=true ..`
6. Build the project: `cmake --build . -j $(($(nproc) + 1))`
7. Run the tests: `cmake --build . --target run_ebpfpub_tests`

## eBPFTracer

eBPFTracer is both a sample and a small utility. It can be used to perform system-wide syscall tracing from the command line.
